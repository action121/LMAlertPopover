# LMAlertPopover

Summary
-------

LMAlertPopover provides a simple API for showing an NSAlert as Popover (NSPopover).

ARC is currently not supported but it should be easy to convert the project. Alternatively, if your project is using ARC, you can also just disable it for LMAlertPopover.m ([see this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646052)).
